## My process

### Built with

- Html
- CSS

### What I learned


<h4>I already knew about how to do <strike><del>this</del></strike> but forgot about it so by researching I got to know about the <strong>strike</strong> tag it's a fallback as <strong>del</strong> isn't visible in every browser</h4>

```html
<p class="old-price">
  <strike>
    <del>$169.99</del>
  </strike>
</p>
```

<h4>This was the code that finally like damn finally worked and the mobile version was good and happy :D</h4>

```css
.box {
  max-width: 375px;
  margin: 1em auto;
  display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

<h4>Making mobile friendly websites are kinda difficult but I'll be glad to continue doing it</h4>

### Useful resources

## Thoughts

<h4>It was easy but still there were some places where I got stuck (centering & responsiveness) so this helped me narrow down some of my weak points and also forced me to try different ways to style things</h4>
